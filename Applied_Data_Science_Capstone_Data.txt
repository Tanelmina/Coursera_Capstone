Data
Instead of Foursquare, this work relies to very similar Xeno-canto API. Just an instead of a venues we have observations and instead of a venues category we have name of species. More general description is available on the page: https://www.xeno-canto.org/article/153. 
Reason for the different API use is to slightly better understand and acquire the course material (and likewise the example work added to 5th week doesn’t use Foursquare)
During this exercise ArcGIS also used – to retrieve England and Wales counties names that correspond the coordinates retrieved from Xeno-canto.
